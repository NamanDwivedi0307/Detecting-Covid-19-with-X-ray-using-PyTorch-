# Detecting-Covid-19-with-X-ray-using-PyTorch
Project Description
In this project, PyTorch is used to create and train a ResNet-18 model and apply it to a set of chest X-ray data. This dataset has nearly 3000 Chest X-Ray scans which are categorized in three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19. Our objective in this project is to create an image classification model that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes with a reasonably high accuracy.
