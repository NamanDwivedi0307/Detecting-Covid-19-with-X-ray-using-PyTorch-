# 🩺 Chest X-Ray Classification with PyTorch (ResNet-18)

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify chest X-ray scans into three categories: **Normal**, **Viral Pneumonia**, and **COVID-19**. Leveraging **PyTorch** and a **ResNet-18 architecture**, the goal is to achieve high accuracy in detecting COVID-19 and related lung conditions from X-ray images.

---

## 📌 Project Description

Using a dataset of nearly **3,000 labeled chest X-ray images**, we built an **image classification model** trained on **ResNet-18**. The model learns to distinguish between:
- 🟢 Normal lungs
- 🟠 Viral Pneumonia cases
- 🔴 COVID-19 infections

This project demonstrates the practical application of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** in **medical imaging** and shows how deep learning can support early diagnosis and healthcare solutions.
